# WavFreqAnalyze
This analyzer can process PCM .wav/.wave files and calculate max and min frequency of signal in every channel

For now frequency is calculated by averag frequency method (look https://www.rotr.info/electronics/prj/fmeter/freq_def.htm#av_freq)

## _Only standart C++23 libs used_
## _Tested on Linux Ubuntu 6.8.0-40-generic with gcc-13.1.0_
