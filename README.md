# WavFreqAnalyze
This analyzer can process PCM .wav/.wave files and calculate max and min frequency of signal in every channel
For now frequency is calculated primitively and not accurately - by simply searching for repeating amplitude values

## _Only standart C++23 libs used_
## _Tested on Linux Ubuntu 6.8.0-40-generic with gcc-13.1.0_
